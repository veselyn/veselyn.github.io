Hi!

I'm a software engineer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I specialize in platform
engineering but I'm comfortable working across the stack.

I care about making it easier for engineers to do their best work. Thatâ€™s why I
build tools and platforms that help teams ship better software, faster, and
with more confidence.

Having worked across the stack, I know what engineers need --- simplicity, fast
feedback loops, and smooth developer workflows.
